**Creative Library**  is a **fabric** mod that replaces the hotbar tab with a customizable library tab where you can store all of your custom items.  To edit the contents of the tab, click the edit button ( the button with a backpack on it). The slots in the edit screen don't take items, they copy it, this is to not freak out servers. The icon was made by the wonderful [Floofy Neko [TW: NSFW]](https://twitter.com/floofyneko69).

#### Coming Up
* Ability to have the Creative Library tab alongside the Hotbar tab
* Multiple library tabs 

#### Forge?
I do not have any plans to port this to Forge, however the [license is MIT](https://github.com/Minenash/Creative-Library/blob/master/LICENSE), therefore if anyone wants to port it, they are free to do so.
