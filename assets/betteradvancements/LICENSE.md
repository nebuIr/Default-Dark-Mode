You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, etc etc.

This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones (any "click past an ad before you can download" service) to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

###Reserved Rights
I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me. However, if I ever change this license, the old version will continue to apply to all revisions prior to the change; the new version will only apply to revisions after the change.
